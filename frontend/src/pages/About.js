          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            I am Anmol Sahu, currently in my 3rd year of college pursuing BTech from Motilal Nehru Institute of Technology, Allahabad. My aim is to build 'Earndrive' into a successful platform that not only connects bike owners and riders but also contributes to a greener and more connected world. As a passionate entrepreneur, I believe in the power of innovative ideas and the drive to turn dreams into reality. Building 'Earndrive' is more than just a projectâ€”it's a mission to make transportation more accessible and efficient for everyone. Let's ride together towards a brighter, more sustainable future!
